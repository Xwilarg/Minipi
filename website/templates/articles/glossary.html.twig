<h3 class="subtitle">Emergency mode</h3>
<p>
    Emergency mode is a special state where all the components of a minipi are disabled, except for her life core, battery and pin<br>
    This typically occur to preserve a minipi integrity and prevent her from hurting herself, either because an outside event or from an inner defect<br>
    This also allow her to keep a nearly-discharged battery for up to a dozen days<br>
    When this happen, all the volatile memory of the minipi is discarded and she will be totally unresponsive<br>
    <br>
    This can be observed when a minipi pin emit a soft red glow<br>
    In case of such an event, please only touch the minipi if she is in immediate danger and contact either Pi or another minipi<br>
    <br>
    This scenario usually occur in the following cases:
    <ul>
        <li>A minipi ran out of battery</li>
        <li>A shock forced a minipi to expel her battery</li>
        <li>A system violation was detected by the minipi Pi[OS]</li>
        <li>The minipi pi safety guard was triggered</li>
    </ul>
    A minipi is only able to be removed from this state by Pi, and is always followed by a deep maintenance
</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Pin safety guard</h3>
<p>
    The safety guard is a functionality attached to a minipi pin<br>
    When a minipi physical integrity is endagered or when its signal to the central server is too weak (meaning a minipi wandered too far away), the security is triggered<br>
    When that happen, the minipi is instantly transported in a receptacle area and her emergency mode is triggered
</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Deep maintenance</h3>
<p>
    Deep maintance is a process usually done after emergency mode to repair and recalibrate a minipi<br>
    It is a time-expensive maneuver that can only be done by Pi, and involve many hardware and software steps to repair structucal and internal defects<br>
    A deep maintenance also always involve changing the minipi emergency battery
</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Soft maintenance</h3>
<p>
    Soft maintenance are a kind of maintance done by minipis in Pi's house<br>
    It allow them to recalibrate their software and once started usually take a full day<br>
    It contains many steps such as recalibrating their internal clock, defragmenting their memory, testing their various sensors, refilling their coolant, comparing the integrity of their system to a reference database and updating it, etc…
</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Daily maintenance</h3>
<p>
    Daily maintenance are done each evening in Pi's house<br>
    They are usually done in parrallel of their battery charging, it is used by minipi to organize their memories and transfert data from their volatile to permanent memory
</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Charging pod</h3>
<p>
    A charging pod is a small container where a minipi lie down during their daily maintenance<br>
    Each minipi have their own charging pod, they also contains a small compartiment at the bottom that they use to store what they like
</p>
<h3 class="subtitle">Charging stations</h3>
<p>
    Charging stations are little cabins that can be found in the street, they give a rest point to minipi and offer various services like an outlet allowing themselves to charge a bit, a map of the city so lost minipis can find their way back and are also used by various others services provided by minipis such as relay points for the <acronym title="MiniPi Delivery Service">MPDS</acronym><br>
    When a minipi enter emergency mode, others minipis will often carry her here, offering her a safe place until Pi's arrival
